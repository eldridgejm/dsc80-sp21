    "\n",
    "##### Missing by Design (MD)\n",
    "- The missing field is deliberately missing. The missing field is deliberately not collected or set to null (hence, \"missing by design\")\n",
    "- The missingness can be exactly predicted when a column will be null, with only knowledge of the other columns using a function of the rows of the dataset\n",
    "- **Example:** The executive board of a student organization is trying to choose 5 new board members for next year from a selection pool of 50. The selection process includes three rounds. After each round, each participant is ranked on a scale of 0 to 100 and only the top 50% of participants in each round are chosen to go to the next round. *In this scenario, only participants who scored highly in each round will have scores for the next round. Therefore, scores for rounds 2 and 3 are missing by design (MD) because only high scoring participants from the previous round will have these scores.*\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Missing Completely At Random (MCAR)\n",
    "- The missingness of missing value isn't related to the actual, unreported value itself, nor the values in any other fields. The missingness is not systematic.\n",
    "- The missingness is unconditionally uniform across rows. MCAR doesn't bias the observed data.\n",
    "- There is no relationship between the missing data and the any of the other data, observed or missing.\n",
    "- **Example:** A student organization is taking headshots for all of their members (the order of the students is completely random). About 2 hours into the photo shoot, the camera battery dies and some of the students are left without headshots. *In this scenario, the missing headshots (data) has nothing to do with the students or anything they did (it was completely random), it was just bad luck. Therefore, the missingness of the headshots is missing completely at random (MCAR) because there is no correlation between the missing headshots and any of the other variables regarding the organization members.*\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Missing At Random (MAR)\n",
    "- The missingness of the missing value has nothing to do with the value itself, but may be related to another field.\n",
    "- The missingness is uniform across rows, perhaps conditional on another column. MAR biases the observed data, but is fixable.\n",
    "- There is a systematic relationship between the missing values and the observed data (but not the missing values themselves).\n",
    "- Difference between MD and MAR: If you can *exactly/always* determine missingness on other columns, the missingness is MD. If there is just some sort of systematic relationship between the missing columns/values and other columns/values that may help us predict missingness, the missingness is MAR.\n",
    "- **Example:** A department (let's say it's the DSC department) has a dataframe of all the students in the DSC major, their grades in all of the DSC classes, and their grade level. Some of the students have NaN values for certain DSC courses and the department notices that there's a lot of missingness for first year students. *In this scenario, the missing grades (data) is related to the students' grade level because most first year students haven't had the opportunity to take certain courses such as DSC80 or DSC170 yet because they haven't finished their prerequsite classes. Therefore, the missingness of the grades is missing at random (MAR) because there is a relation between the missing grades and the grade levels of the students (observed data).*\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Not Missing At Random (NMAR)\n",
    "- The missingness of the missing value is related to the actual, unreported value.\n",
    "- NMAR biases the observed data in unobservable ways.\n",
    "- There is relationship between the propensity of a value to be missing and its value.\n",
    "- **Example:** A company is hiring students for an internship. On the online application, the GPA field is optional (while fields such as Name, Email, etc. are not). The company notices that some of the applications don't have a submitted GPA. *In this scenario, students with lower GPAs are less likely to self-report their GPA. Therefore, the missingness of the GPAs is not missing at random (NMAR) because there is a relation between the missing GPAs and the actual values of the missing GPAs.*\n",

    "- If dependent on more than one column: use linear regression to predict missing value.\n",
